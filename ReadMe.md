# üè® Hotelligence: Hotel Booking Prediction System

This project is a machine learning solution designed to help hotels make smarter decisions by predicting:

- üìä **Booking Cancellation Probability**
- üí∞ **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**

Both predictions are based on real-world guest input data (e.g., lead time, stay duration, room type).
